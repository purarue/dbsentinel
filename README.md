This is a work in progress

A counterpart to <https://sean.fish/mal_unapproved/>. That lists entries that have yet to be approved

This lists entries that are approved, with the most recently approved entries at the top

Planned stuff:

- Display all the cached info as a basic SPA
- Ping unapproved instance to get a list of all unapproved items periodically
- API which the SPA requests to (and anyone else can use -- should allow CORS anything on it)
- integrate with [notify-bot](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/mal-notify-bot) so that sources added there get added to the website
- let a user request their list and only show items that arent on their list already
