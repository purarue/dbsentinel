This is a work in progress

A counterpart to <https://sean.fish/mal_unapproved/>. That lists entries that have yet to be approved, denied entries and deleted entries

This lists entries that are approved, with the most recently approved entries at the top

# WORK IN PROGRESS

- [ ] frontend with discord login
- [ ] dashboard that shows stats etc.
- [ ] API for deleted/denied/unapproved ids/names
- [ ] roles to give people more permissions
- [ ] let users refresh data for old entries
- [ ] integrate with [notify-bot](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/mal-notify-bot) so that sources added there get added to the website (also allow items which arent in #feed -- so this can source anything) -- only show on website through a domain allowlist
- [ ] connect IDs to anilist (using local `URLCache`)
- [ ] connect IDs to tmdb (manually, users can submit requests)
